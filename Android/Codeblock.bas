'* No.        Who  Date        Description
'* =====      ===  ==========  ======================================================
'* 1.04.3     MTE  2016/10/11  - Removed Mtelog from B4J library. B4A and B4I ok.
'* 1.04.2     MTE  2016/10/09  - Added trig functions, round(), floor(), and ceil().
'*                             - Replaced FindInternalFunc case statement with a
'*                               lookup table.
'*                             - Added support for variable assignments.
'* 1.03       MTE  2016/08/30  - Added support for bitwise operators << >> ~ ^
'*                             - Added internal function Power()
'*                             - Removed Push instructions in DoIIF.  Push was not 
'*                               needed. This caused the error in the Kitchen Sink test 
'*                               case.
'*                             - Prefixed Types with MTE_ to prevent naming conflicts 
'*                               with Type definitions in applications.
'* 1.02       MTE  2016/08/26  - Fixed syntax error bug with parenthetical expression
'*                               lists. 
'*                             - Moved software CPU to local stack to support Codeblock 
'*                               nesting
'*                             - Added support for hexadecimal number format 0xNNNN
'*                             - Added strucural code to support bitwise operators
'*                             - Added syntax error trap for bitwise ops until supported.
'* 1.01       MTE  2016/08/23  - Added #if B4I in Run.bas for Mod operator
'*                             - Added #if B4I and custom ExtractExpressions until 
'*                               we sort out the RegEx difference between B4A and B4I 
'* 1.00       MTE  2016/08/23  - Preparing for release
'* 0.01       MTE  2016/08/11  - Begin here!
